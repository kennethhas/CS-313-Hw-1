q1o
Create a function for a linked list that sorts the list so that first all odd numbers are listed
and then all even numbers.



For this question we need algorithm design , I approach this problem with a simple mind set I just need to change the first and last node of the even and odd and if the last odd node is null ia quickly appoint the last odd node to the first even node , and if the last even node appoint to an odd node the I will appoint the the node to the last odd node changing it to the last odd node . and let the loop end . and the first even node will be appointed by the last odd node
